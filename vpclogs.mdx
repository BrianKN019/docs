<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Ensure you have an active AWS account and permissions to create and manage VPCs, EC2 instances, and Flow Logs.
</Info>

This guide will walk you through setting up an Amazon VPC, launching an EC2 instance, enabling Flow Logs, and monitoring network traffic using CloudWatch.

---

## Step 1: Create a VPC

To create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), follow the steps below:

<CodeGroup>
  ```aws-cli
  aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16
  ```

  ```console
  # Using the AWS Management Console:
  1. Open the **VPC** dashboard in the AWS Console.
  2. Select **Your VPCs** from the left-hand navigation bar.
  3. Click **Create VPC**.
  4. Select **VPC and More** as the template.
  5. Enter a name, e.g., **MyVPC**, and use the default CIDR block `10.0.0.0/16`.
  6. Leave IPv6 CIDR block as "No IPv6 CIDR block".
  7. Select 1 public subnet and 1 availability zone.
  8. Disable NAT Gateways to minimize costs.
  9. Click **Create VPC**.
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  **Tip**: If you plan to use private subnets, consider adding NAT Gateways for internet access from private instances.

## Step 2: Launch an EC2 Instance

Now that your VPC is ready, launch an EC2 instance within it:

1. Navigate to the **EC2 console** and click **Launch Instances**.
2. Configure the instance with these details:
   - **Name**: `Instance - MyVPC Project`.
   - **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**: Select **Amazon Linux 2023 AMI**.
   - **Instance Type**: `t2.micro` (eligible for free tier).
   - **Network settings**: 
     - Select the **MyVPC** VPC.
     - Choose the public subnet created earlier.
     - Enable public IP auto-assignment.
   - **Security group**: Create a new group called `SG - MyVPC Project`:
     - Add an inbound rule to allow SSH traffic (port 22) from your IP.

<CodeGroup>
  ```aws-cli
  aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
    --instance-type t2.micro \
    --key-name MyKeyPair \
    --security-group-ids sg-0abc12345def67890 \
    --subnet-id subnet-0abc123456def7890
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 3: Enable Flow Logs

Flow Logs allow you to monitor network traffic for your VPC. Follow these steps to enable them:

1. Go to the **VPC console**, select your VPC, and open the **Flow Logs** tab.
2. Click **Create Flow Log** and configure:
   - **Filter**: `All`.
   - **Destination**: `CloudWatch Logs`.
   - Create or select an IAM role that allows VPC to publish logs to CloudWatch.

<CodeGroup>
  ```aws-cli
  aws ec2 create-flow-logs \
    --resource-type VPC \
    --resource-ids vpc-0abc123456def7890 \
    --traffic-type ALL \
    --log-group-name MyFlowLogs \
    --deliver-logs-permission-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyFlowLogsRole
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Viewing Logs in CloudWatch

Once Flow Logs are enabled, you can monitor network traffic in CloudWatch:

1. Open the **CloudWatch console** and select **Log Groups**.
2. Find your log group (e.g., `MyFlowLogs`) and explore the entries.
3. Analyze the data to identify unusual traffic patterns or troubleshoot connectivity.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I don't see any data in Flow Logs">
    Ensure:
    1. The IAM role has the correct permissions to publish logs to CloudWatch.
    2. There is traffic in the VPC (test by using commands like `ping` or `curl` from your instance).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="EC2 instance is not accessible via SSH">
    Verify:
    1. The instance is in a public subnet and has a public IP assigned.
    2. The security group has an inbound rule to allow SSH traffic from your IP.
    3. Your local machine allows outgoing SSH traffic.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Conclusion

Youâ€™ve successfully:
1. Created a VPC.
2. Launched an EC2 instance within the VPC.
3. Enabled Flow Logs to monitor network traffic.

<Tip>
  Explore additional AWS networking features like private subnets, NAT gateways, and VPC endpoints to enhance your architecture.
