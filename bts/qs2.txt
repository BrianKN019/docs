## Setting Up Your Documentation üöÄ

Ready to create the ultimate documentation portal? Follow these steps to set up, preview, and deploy your documentation efficiently.

### Edit and Preview üõ†Ô∏è

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Clone Your Documentation Repository">
    Your documentation lives in a dedicated GitHub repository. Clone it locally to start editing! Follow the 
    [GitHub cloning guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    or access the repository directly from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/documentation.git
    cd documentation
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="laptop-code" title="Run Your Documentation Locally">
    Preview changes in real-time before deploying. Install the Mintlify CLI to run your documentation locally.

    1. Install Mintlify CLI:
    ```bash
    npm i -g mintlify
    ```

    2. Navigate to your project directory and run:
    ```bash
    mintlify dev
    ```

    3. Access your local preview at `http://localhost:3000`.

</AccordionGroup>

### Deploy Your Changes üåê

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Install the Deployment Bot">
    Simplify your deployment process by installing the GitHub deployment bot. This bot ensures your changes are automatically pushed live.

    1. Install the bot via your [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
    2. Verify the bot is active by checking for a green checkmark next to your commits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="cloud-upload" title="Push Your Changes">
    Commit and push your changes to GitHub to deploy them to your live site.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update documentation"
    git push origin main
    ```

    If the deployment bot is inactive, trigger the update manually through the dashboard.
