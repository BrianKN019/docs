## Welcome to the Quickstart üöÄ

This guide will help you set up, explore, and interact with my documentation portal. Whether you're diving into **web development**, **AWS cloud solutions**, or **data analytics**, this quickstart will have you up and running in no time.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Learn how to set up, preview, and collaborate effectively while working with my projects.

### ‚ö° Edit and Preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone Project Repositories">
    All project repositories are hosted on GitHub for easy access. Use the commands below to clone and start exploring:

    cat templates/deployment.yaml

    # Deploy infrastructure
    aws cloudformation deploy --template-file templates/deployment.yaml --stack-name my-aws-stack
    ```
    </CodeSnippet>

    <CodeSnippet title="Clone the Solar Sizing Calculator">
    ```bash

### üåê Deploy Your Work

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push Changes to GitHub">
    After making updates, commit and push the changes back to the repository. Use this quick command:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your update message"
    git push origin main
    ```
    Learn more about pushing commits [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="cloud" title="Deploy to the Cloud">
    My projects leverage modern platforms like Vercel and AWS. Deployments are often automated, but you can trigger them manually if needed:

    ```bash
    # Trigger a Vercel deployment manually
    vercel deploy
    ```
    View the deployed projects at:
    - [Business Website](https://msolution-ke.vercel.app/)
