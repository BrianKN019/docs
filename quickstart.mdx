## Welcome to the Quickstart üöÄ

This guide will help you set up, explore, and interact with my documentation portal. Whether you're diving into **web development**, **AWS cloud solutions**, or **data analytics**, this quickstart will have you up and running in no time.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Learn how to set up, preview, and collaborate effectively while working with my projects.

### ‚ö° Edit and Preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone Project Repositories">
    All project repositories are hosted on GitHub for easy access. You can clone these repositories locally by following these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
    <br/>
    Once cloned, you'll have access to the codebase, documentation, and tools to explore the inner workings of each project.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview Changes">
    To preview changes or experiment locally:
    1. Make sure to install the required dependencies using the package manager of your choice (e.g., `npm` or `yarn`).
    2. Run the following command in the terminal at the root of the project directory:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    3. This will start a local server where you can view live updates to your changes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### üåê Deploy Your Work

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push Changes to GitHub">
    After making your updates, commit and push the changes back to the repository. This ensures that all collaborators and systems are updated with your latest contributions. Learn more about pushing commits
    [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="cloud" title="Deploy to the Cloud">
    My projects are hosted on modern platforms like Vercel and AWS. Once your changes are pushed, automated workflows handle deployments. If needed, you can trigger manual deployments via platforms like
    [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or directly from the project's dashboard.
